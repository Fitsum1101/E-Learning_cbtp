# Introduction to HTML

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is the standard markup language for creating web pages.

## What is HTML?

HTML describes the **structure** of a web page using **tags**. A basic HTML document looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can create one `.md` file per lesson. Name it after the lesson slug:

Each file can then be uploaded and rendered just like in the Express app you built.

- An admin UI to write/edit Markdown from the browser?
